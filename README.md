Hi, I'm Ignacio Carvajal, a software engineering student at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (UAM) EPS. I'm passionate about coding and am always learning new technologies.

On my GitHub profile, you will find various projects that I have been working on, such as:

*   **8Game-A-Search**: A puzzle game that utilizes the Breadth-first search and A\* search algorithms to find solutions. The game allows players to use arrow keys to move the empty tile and rearrange the tiles, and also offers the option to search for solutions using the " " key for Breadth-first search algorithm, and the "s" key for A\* search algorithm.
    
*   **Chess-interface-Javascript**: A chess game that can be played against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves and a heuristic function to evaluate the board position.
    
*   **Pathfinding-Javascript**: A visualization tool for the A\* pathfinding algorithm. The tool allows users to create a grid of obstacles and select starting and ending points for the algorithm to find the shortest path between.
    
*   **Reversi-Javascript**: An implementation of the classic board game Reversi (also known as Othello) with AI functionality for computer players.
    

All of my projects are open-source and implemented in JavaScript or Python. I welcome contributions and encourage others to use and build upon them.
